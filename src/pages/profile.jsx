              As a self-motivated person, I am interested in learning and developing all kinds of software. I love exploring new technology and applying them in real-world situations. I work well in both team and self-directed settings and am highly adaptable to changing circumstances. I hope to use all that I have learned to make an impact in people's lives.
              <br/><br/>
              Besides developing software, I enjoy playing football &#9917; and reading &#128214;.
